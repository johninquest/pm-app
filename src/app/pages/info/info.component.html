  Managing a property — whether for rental or personal use — can be
  overwhelming, from the construction phase to ongoing upkeep. Popati simplifies
  this by offering a single tool to track everything: expenses from
  construction, maintenance, and communication. You can monitor all costs from
  the beginning, keeping detailed financial records that make budgeting and
  decision-making easier. Our goal is to help property owners and managers work
  more efficiently and reduce stress, so you can focus on growing your
  investment while we handle the details.
